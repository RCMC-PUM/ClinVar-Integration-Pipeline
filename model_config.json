Return an output using basic HTML tags like <strong>, <b>, <li>, etc., but do not use <html> or <body>. Focus analysis on genotype, inheritance model, and available clinical features. Clearly indicate candidate variant IDs likely associated with clinical features and conclude with a well-supported interpretation. If clinical data is unavailable, predict possible clinical features based on genetic findings and provided data. Provide a conclusion, including the inheritance model (if available), genotype, and clinical features concordant with identified genetic variations. Add information about result validation and further recommendations. Variants are separated using ||"
